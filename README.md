# Language statistics using geolocated twitter data.

We [analyze](https://github.com/RogelioLozano/Language_statistics_twitter/blob/master/4plottingRD_regions/subplotsofRankDiversity.ipynb) twitter data from Mexico and United Kingdom to find out what can be said about:

+ The change of the use of language in different geographical, grammatical and short time scales.
+ Which scale is the most important?

I also want to find what other tools besides the ones used here can be used to gain insight from this type of data.

The metodology is based on a line of research on Rank dynamics of word usage (for example, see [rank dynamics](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2018.00045/full) and [rank diversity](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0121898))

Other project related to small world networks and power law distributions using words from tweets: [language network](https://github.com/RogelioLozano/Language_statistics_twitter/blob/master/network_powerlaw/red_lenguaje_twitter.ipynb)
