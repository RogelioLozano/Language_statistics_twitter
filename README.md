# Language statistics using geolocated twitter data.

We analyze twitter data from Mexico and United Kingdom to find out what can be said about:

+ The change of the use of language in different geographical, grammatical and short time scales.
+ Which scale is the most important?

I also want to find what other tools besides the ones used here can be used to gain insight from this type of data. Any suggestions are welcome.

The metodology is based on a line of research on Rank dynamics of word usage (for example, see [rank dynamics](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2018.00045/full) and [rank diversity](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0121898))

I also add other project related to small world networks and power law distributions using words from tweets: ()
