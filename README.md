# Language statistics using geolocated twitter data.

In this project twitter data from three Spanish-speaking and one English-speaking countries: Mexico, Spain, Argentina and United Kingdom is [analyzed](https://github.com/RogelioLozano/Language_statistics_twitter/blob/master/4plottingRD_regions/subplotsofRankDiversity.ipynb)  to find out what can be said about:

+ The change of the use of language in different geographical, grammatical and short time scales.
+ Which scale is the most important?

The metodology is based on a line of research related to rank dynamics of word usage (for example, see [rank dynamics](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2018.00045/full) and [rank diversity](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0121898))

This project is part of the work that I did in my social service at Instituto de Investigaciones en Matem√°ticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS).
